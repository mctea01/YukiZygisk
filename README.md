# YukiZygisk

A new kernel-level Zygisk implementation designed to explore better, cleaner, and more flexible ways of injecting.

## Project Notes

This repository is the extraction target for the YukiZygisk work currently living in YukiSU.

Start here:

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) - working rules for agents and maintainers.
- [docs/project-state.md](docs/project-state.md) - current YukiSU source state and verified capability snapshot.
- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) - current architecture boundaries and source map.
- [docs/extraction-plan.md](docs/extraction-plan.md) - staged plan for turning the YukiSU branch into a standalone project.
- [docs/source-inventory.md](docs/source-inventory.md) - exact imported source files and remaining host dependencies.
- [docs/validation-and-device-safety.md](docs/validation-and-device-safety.md) - build checks, CI checks, and device-operation constraints.

## Kernel LKM Skeleton

The first standalone kernel skeleton lives in [kernel](kernel). It imports the
current YukiSU YukiZygisk kernel feature files and builds an Android
`android16-6.12` LKM through DDK:

```bash
ddk build -- W=1
```

This is a buildable extraction checkpoint, not a complete runtime replacement
for the YukiSU-integrated module yet. See the source inventory for the
remaining daemon/userspace control, payload staging, and host-backend runtime
validation work. The kernel-side setresuid tracepoint monitor, SELinux policy
adapter, and mount cleanup adapter are present in the standalone LKM, but still
need device-side validation before they can be treated as runtime parity.

The standalone control path no longer creates `/dev/yukizygisk`. The LKM arms a
one-shot `prctl` bootstrap when loaded with a per-boot cookie; `zygiskd` claims
an anonymous control fd immediately after startup and then reuses the
`YZ_IOCTL_*` command surface on that fd.

If zygiskd never claims the bootstrap fd, the kernel guard checks for zygote
service sockets after a short delay. Once service startup is visible, the guard
clears the bootstrap cookie, removes the temporary `prctl` hook, and requests a
best-effort self-unload through `toybox rmmod yukizygisk`.

The standalone design target is root-implementation agnostic. KSU/YukiSU,
KernelPatch, APatch, Magisk, and other high-CAP root environments should be
host backends, not project owners. Kernel code should call YukiZygisk-owned
`yz_*` and `yz_host_*` interfaces. Host initialization now reuses the
Kasumi runtime resolver and root implementation detector under YukiZygisk
naming.

The LSM interception point is now extracted into the standalone host layer:
`selinux_bprm_committed_creds` is patched through a versioned adapter that uses
the 6.12+ `static_calls_table` path or the older `security_hook_heads` path.

Standalone mount cleanup is also owned by YukiZygisk now. `YZ_IOCTL_UMOUNT_PID`
schedules target-context task work, scans that app's `/proc/self/mountinfo`,
and detaches KSU/Magisk/APatch/YukiZygisk tagged mounts plus `/data/adb` module
mounts itself. It must not depend on KSU's `kernel_umount` feature being
enabled.

The standalone control ABI is `YZ_IOCTL_*` with ioctl magic `'Y'` only. It does
not accept the integrated YukiSU/YukiZygisk `KSU_IOCTL_YZ_*`/`'K'` ABI.

The default packaging direction is a normal module containing `yukizygisk.ko`,
`zygiskd`, `libzygisk.so`, `libyukilinker.so`, and `libyukizncore.so`, with
`post-fs-data.sh` loading the LKM and starting the daemon. This gives up
early-native injection by default; that capability can remain a future optional
host backend rather than the baseline standalone path.
